Difference with GNU regex

   + has original native API. (Thread safe?  I hope so.)
   + has modified GNU regex API.
      - re_compile_fastmap() is removed. (no needs to call)
      - re_recompile_pattern() is added.
      - re_alloc_pattern()    is added.
   + octal or hexadecimal number sequence can be treated as 
     multibyte code in char-class[..] (ex. [\xa1\xa2]).
   + POSIX bracket [:ascii:] is added. (Perl extension ?)


ToDo

   + GNU autoconf
   ? Add new stack type for opcode OP_ANYCHAR_STAR(.*) matching process.
     [STK_ANYCHAR_STAR, address, str-low, str-now]
   ? Ruby M17N (re-check specification, see MB2WC_AVAILABLE(enc))
  ?? dynamic eval {?{Ruby code...})     I don't know Perl. :-)
  ?? POSIX compatible API
