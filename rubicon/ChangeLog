	* builtin/TestArray.rb: Aleksi again. Add test for array.push with 
	no argument.

	* builtin/TestTime.rb: Thanks to Aleksi for this one. We can't
	create local times of 1970,1,1,0,0,0 when we're east of Greenwich, 
	so I hacked the dates forward a year. Also changed isdst to remove 
	checks for US changes from DST to standard time when not in the
	US, and tidied layout a tad

	* rubicon.rb (VersionNumber): Add a class to encapsulate Ruby versions

	* builtin/TestFile.rb: create local socket, rather than relying on 
	/tmp/.X11 stuff

	* builtin/TestFileTest.rb: ditto
