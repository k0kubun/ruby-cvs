2001-11-10  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* language/TestRegularExpressions.rb: Guy Decoux supplied a total
	of almost 3,000 regular expression tests, based on various P*
	language ones.

	* builtin/ArrayBase.rb: Matt Armstrong submitted patches for
	indexing past the end of an array.

2001-11-09  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* Various: Add support for generating the results in XML format,
	and start working on getting the tests more consistent on the
	Windows platforms.

2001-11-04  Masaki Suketa <masaki.suketa@nifty.ne.jp>

	* StringBase, TestClass, TestFile, TestMath: found various tests
	which used assert(....) instead of asert_equal etc...

2001-11-02    <dave@pragmaticprogrammer.com>

	* Various: Start getting tests to run under MsWin32. Add
	better support for OS dependent blocks of code.

2001-10-25  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* Various: Fixes to remove implicit dependence on order of tests
	(found when NT ran under Lapidary, which uses different order to
	runit).

2001-10-25  Nobu Nakad <nobu.nokada@softhome.net>
	* language/TestFlip.rb: Added. Test .. and ... operators

	* AllTests.rb: Invoking without arguments, run testsuits under
	rubicon's directory, not current directory.

	* builtin/StringBase.rb: Tests for String#[re] bug fix.

	* builtin/TestFile.rb: On linux with devfsd, /dev/fd0 is not a
	block device.

	* builtin/TestKernel.rb: Allocation framework changed at 1.7.1
	2001-10-16. Alias of global variable improved (DT: only on 1.7)

	* builtin/TestModulePrivate.rb: Module#instance_methods doesn't
	preserve the order.

	* builtin/TestRegexp.rb: Duped Regexp's ID differs from original's
	one.

	* builtin/TestThread.rb: Should wait until t1 wake up.

	* language/TestScope.rb: Tests for special variables($_, $~ and so
	on) and thread (modified by DT: only for >= 1.7)

2001-08-02  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* rubicon.rb (runChild): Fix typo (thanks to Yamada-san for
	finding it)

2001-07-27    <dave@pragmaticprogrammer.com>

	* builtin\StringBase.rb: Use of $= is deprecated as of 1.7.1

	* builtin\TestIO.rb: Under Windows, the CR is stripped out of
	lines we read, so we can't simply add the length of the input to
	arrive at the file position. Putting files into binary mode fixes
	this.

	* builtin\TestFixnum.rb: On my windows box, 0**-1 returns -Infinity,
	rather that +Infinity. Who cares as long as it's infinite... :)

	* builtin\TestStruct__Tms.rb (TimesClass): Under Windows, burning
	CPU by creating and deleting a directory 5,000 times takes forever
	and is effectively non-interruptable. Change it to loop for no
	more than three seconds. Also start removing the Cygwin
	unsupported stuff.

2001-07-27    <dave@pragmaticprogrammer.com>
	Start getting stuff to work under Windows. First we get Cygwin working,
	and then we attack the MSVC version.
	
	* builtin\TestFile.rb: Can't test fifo's under Windows.
	File sizes of files containing newlines are different under DOS.

	* builtin\TestDir.rb: Need to close the directory at the end of
	tests in order to allow Windows to delete it.

	* builtin\TestTime.rb: Under Windows the clock resolution means
	that we need to insert a sleep to have two consecutive Time.now's
	be different.

	* builtin\TestKernel.rb: Cygwin apparently doesn't honor a signal disposition 
	of 'IGNORE', so skip the test under test_s_trap

2001-07-25  Hugh Sasse

	* FileTest.rb: Add File.join tests in light of ruby-talk:18512

2001-07-23  Patrick Cheng <pcyc@hotmail.com>

	* rubicon.rb: Make files r/w before deleting.

2001-06-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* Fixed a couple of warnings resulting from running tests in one
	pass. 

	* Makefile: changed default target to run library and builtins
	tests in a single pass, so we now get just one summary table
	
	

2001-06-10  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* language/*: added all the tests from the standard test.rb
	file. Most of these go into various files in the language
	subdirectory, but some are class specific. The latter go into the
	appropriate files in builtins

2001-06-05  Yukihiro Matsumoto  <matz@ruby-lang.org>

	* builtin/TestModule.rb: list of constants should be sorted before
	  comparison.

2001-04-23  Yukihiro Matsumoto  <matz@ruby-lang.org>

	* builtin/TestFixnum.rb: -1 (in fact, negative integers in
	  general) should be considered as infinite sequence of 1 bits,
	  so that checkBits() test on -1 should be removed.

2001-03-28  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestTime.rb: Time.zone now returns 'UTC' rather than 'GMT'

	* builtin/TestStruct__Tms.rb,TestTime,TestProcess: the .times
 	method moved to Process in 1.7

2001-03-20  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestMarshal.rb: Add test for Bignum marshalling.

2001-02-19  Yukihiro Matsumoto  <matz@ruby-lang.org>

	* builtin/StringBase.rb: I finally agreed that "FooBar"[6,2]
	  returning nil is a bug (line 17).

2001-02-06  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/ArrayBase.rb: Split out testing of Array-like classes
	from Array itself. This allows Matju to test his ArrayMixin
	classes using rubicon.

2001-02-04  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestKernel.rb: Remove begin/end from .id tests: the
	bug's been fixed.

2001-02-03  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestProc.rb: #arity values changes at 1.6.2

	* builtin/TestArray.rb: Behavior of sort! changes at 1.7

2001-01-18  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* language/TestFloats.rb: Add Aleksi's new tests (thanks).

2001-01-17  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* Makefile (test): Allow name of interpreter to be overridded, so
	that we can test multiple Ruby's on the same box

2001-01-17  Yukihiro Matsumoto  <matz@ruby-lang.org>

	* builtin/TestKernel.rb: replace NotImplementError by
	  NotImplementedError. 

2001-01-13  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/many: Old tests had a bug where they'd try to taint
	frozen objects. Changed the order to taint first, then freeze.

2001-01-11  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestBignum.rb: Fixes to operators used for === and eql?
	(Hugh Sasse)

	* builtin/TestFixnum.rb: Replaced an assert_equal with
	assert_flequal, and added a description to MOD (Hugh Sasse).

2001-01-10  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestString.rb: Added patches to test .dup behavior from
	Hugh Sasse.

	* builtin/TestFloat.rb: Added a number of patches from Hugh Sasse.

2000-11-19  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestArray.rb: (test_sort!) The test for sort! was wrong: it shouldn't 
	return nil for 0 or 1 length arrays (thanks to Ryan Davis)

2000-11-16  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestTime.rb: (test_isdst) Don't do isdst check unless in the US
	(anyone got any ideas on how to test this globally)?

2000-11-16  Yukihiro Matsumoto <matz@zetabits.com>

	* builtin/TestThread.rb: (test_run) Fixed a timing problem.

2000-10-28  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestObjectSpace.rb: (test_s_finalizers) Brian Feldman
	added test.

2000-10-23  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestKernel.rb (test_s_trap): Fix a race condition.

	* builtin/TestDir.rb: Remove dependence on order of entries
	returned by directory operations.

	* builtin/TestIO.rb: Brian Feldman: Make exception returned by
 	File#pos=-1 and seek(-1) less system specific. Use .read, not
 	.sysread, in reopen tests.

	* builtin/TestFile__Stat.rb: Brian Feldman: make /dev/fd0 tests
	Linux specific. Make group tests (gid, grpowned) Linux specific.
	Check stickiness using a directory, not file.

	* builtin/TestFileTest.rb: Brian Feldman: sticky test now checks a 
	directory for portability. Make /dev/fd0 Linux specific. Make
	grpowned and /dev/fd0 tests Linux specific

	* rubicon.rb: Add classification routines for operating systems 

	* builtin/TestArray.rb: Brian Feldman/Aleksi Niemlä: retain test
	for pre 1.6.2 push behavior.

	* rubicon.rb (tidyup): Brian Feldman: delete directories as well
	as files out of _test (used by above).

	* util/checkstat.c (main): Brian Feldman: Make checkstat more
	portable to systems where the fields in a struct stat don't fit in 
	to an int.

2000-10-20  Dave Thomas  <Dave@Thomases.com>

	* builtin/TestArray.rb: Aleksi again. Add test for array.push with 
	no argument.

	* builtin/TestTime.rb: Thanks to Aleksi for this one. We can't
	create local times of 1970,1,1,0,0,0 when we're east of Greenwich, 
	so I hacked the dates forward a year. Also changed isdst to remove 
	checks for US changes from DST to standard time when not in the
	US, and tidied layout a tad

	* rubicon.rb (VersionNumber): Add a class to encapsulate Ruby versions

	* builtin/TestFile.rb: create local socket, rather than relying on 
	/tmp/.X11 stuff

	* builtin/TestFileTest.rb: ditto
