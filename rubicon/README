This is 'rubicon', a test suite for Ruby and it's libraries.


Warning:
========

This software is pre-alpha. It works on my box, and that's all I
know ;-)  Be warning that you're entering the unknown here.


Prerequisites:
==============

  1. These tests were written for Ruby 1.6 and later.

  2. You'll need RubyUnit installed. You need 0.2.2 as a minimum.
     RubyUnit is available from the RAA, or directly at

         http://homepage1.nifty.com/markey/ruby/rubyunit/rubyunit_e.html

  3. I suspect these tests will currently run only on Linux boxes (as
     they rely on 'touch' being available).


Installation:
=============

  You're done it. Simply untar the files into a convenient directory.


Structure:
==========

   Eventually, rubicon will test all of Ruby: the core interpreter,
   the libraries, and various add on modules.  For now, though, we
   have tests for the built-in libraries, and stubs for the language
   features. The tests for the builtins are in the subdirectory
   'builtin', and those for the language are in 'language'. Over time, 
   different directories will be added with additional sets of tests
   (networking, for example).

   In order to run the tests, we need a small amount of support code,
   written in C. This is in the 'util' directory.

Running:
========

   To run all the tests, simply issue:

      make

   at the top level.


   To run all the builtin tests, cd to the 'builtin' directory and
   issue:

      ruby AllBuiltinTests.rb

   To run the tests for a particular builtin class, go to the builtin
   directory and issue:

      ruby Test<classname>.rb

   for example

      ruby TestBignum.rb


   To run an individual test for a particular class, put its name as a 
   parameter

       ruby TestBignum.rb test_OR


Changing:
=========

    Feel free to add tests and strengthen existing ones. I'd
    appreciate context diffs of the changes. All I'd ask is that you
    not add any version of system specific stuff without dropping me a 
    line first: I've got some ideas of how to integrate this cleanly
    which I'd like to talk through with folks.
