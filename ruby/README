* What's Ruby

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and
easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to
process text files and to do system management tasks (as in
perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

* Features of Ruby

  + Simple Syntax
  + *Normal* Object-Oriented features(ex. class, method calls)
  + *Advanced* Object-Oriented features(ex. Mix-in, Singleton-method)
  + Operator Overloading
  + Exception Handling
  + Iterators and Closures
  + Garbage Collection
  + Dynamic Loading of Object files(on some architecture)
  + Highly Portable(works on many UNIX machines)

* How to get Ruby

The Ruby distribution can be found on

  ftp://ftp.netlab.co.jp/pub/lang/ruby/

* How to compile and install

This is what you need to do to compile and install Ruby:

  1. Run ./configure, which will generate config.h and Makefile.

  2. Edit defines.h if you need.  Probably this step will not need.

  3. Remove comment mark(#) before the module names from ext/Setup, if 
     you want to link modules statically.

     If you want to link all the extension modules, remove comment
     mark from the line "#option nodynamic".

  4. Run make.

  5. Optionally, run 'make test' to check that the compiled Ruby
     interpreter works well.  If you see the message "test succeeded", 
     your Ruby works as it should (hopefully).

  6. Run 'make install'

If you fail to compile Ruby, please send the detailed error report with
the error log and machine/OS type, to help others.
