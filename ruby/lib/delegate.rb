#  Delegation class that delegates even methods defined in super class,
# which can not be covered with normal method_missing hack.
#  
#  Delegater is the abstract delegation class. Need to redefine
# `__getobj__' method in the subclass.  SimpleDelegater is the 
# concrete subclass for simple delegation.
#
# Usage:
#   foo = Object.new
#   foo = SimpleDelegater.new(foo)
#   foo.type # => Object
