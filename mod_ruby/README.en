= README for mod_ruby

== What's mod_ruby?

mod_ruby embeds the Ruby interpreter into the Apache web server,
allowing Ruby CGI scripts to be executed natively. These scripts will
start up much faster than without mod_ruby.

== Required environment

* Ruby version 1.6.x or later.
  (Recommends version 1.6.4 or later.)
* Apache version 1.3.3 or later.

You can use Apache 2.0 also, but there are some restrictions.

* You should build mod_ruby as a DSO module. (Please use --with-apxs
  option instead of --with-apache option when running configure.rb.)
* mod_ruby only supports prefork MPM. You can't use threaded MPM.
* Some methods are not implemented for Apache 2.0 because Apache 2.0
  API is different from Apache 1.x API. (mod_ruby 1.1 series will
  support only Apache 2.0 and will provide new API.)

== Installation

(1) Type `./configure.rb' to create Makefile.
    (Type `./configure.rb --help' to get a help message.)

(2) Type `make' to compile mod_ruby.

(3) Type `make install' to install files.

(4) Edit `httpd.conf'. (see examples/httpd.conf.)

(5) Restart Apache.
